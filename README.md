# SPEED App by FFJK
The Software Empirical Evidence Database (SPEED) app was created to be a searchable database of evidence about different claims about different Software Engineering (SE) practices.

The Software Engineering Research Centre exists at Auckland University of Technology, and different research and development teams work at this centre. FFJK is the development team of SE experts chosen to develop the SPEED app.
